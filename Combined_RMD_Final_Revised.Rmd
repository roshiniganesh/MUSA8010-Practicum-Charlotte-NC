This project is a part of 8010 Master of Urban Spatial Analytics (MUSA)/Smart Cities Practicum Spring 2024 and in collaboration with Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS). We would like to give special thanks to our instructors Michael Fichman and Matthew Harris, also to Carlos Parada, Bruce Jones, and Jessica Odette from CATS for providing data, insight, and support over the course in the semester



### 1. Introduction

In 2021, the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) embarked on 'The Bus Priority Study' as part of the city's larger Strategic Mobility Plan, aiming to enhance bus trips' speed, reliability, and convenience for riders. CATS wishes to understand the recent dynamics of local bus transit and the financial and equity ramification of hypothetical alterations to the network. To achieve this goal, CATS set out to identify and understand three primary objectives:

1. Understanding recent bus ridership dynamics involved 
2. Exploring the present reality of bus accessibility, considering ridership trends and demographic distributions.
3. Examining network efficiencies and possibilities 

In pursuit of the three objectives, several actions must be undertaken:

1. Identify underperforming bus stops.
2. Study demographic, spatial, and economic factors in the Charlotte area that potentially influence bus ridership and performance.
3. Alter the current bus network of stops and routes to optimize transit services

The goal of this project is to create a proof-of-concept analytical and informational system to identify underperforming stops or routes in Charlotteâ€™s bus transit network


### 2. Use case
Our team will support CATS transportation planners in improving bus line efficiency by analyzing historical ridership trends per bus stop to identify and predict underperforming stops and routes. Our team want to understand the dynamics of the bus system then develop a model that forecast demand. Our team will model monthly bus demand by line and stop using APC data (boarding and alighting counts)

With this, we will propose alternate network options through a web-based dashboard that presents predictions with the context of demographic, spatial, financial factors of influence.

### 3. Data 

#### 3.1 Datasets considered


The ridership data, boarding and alighting of the passenger is collected by sensors, grouped into a monthly total and calculated daily average format for each stop. This ridership data, the total of board and alight, is the dependent variable of this project.

To analyze and forecast performance trends, we have used ridership data from CATS for the years between 2017 and 2023. Additionally we have identified potential demographic from American Census survey, spatial parameter such as proximity to amenities, and economic parameters that may influence our predictor variable that is ridership. 

#### 3.2 Limitations of dataset

On initial review, certain limitations of the data present themselves. These include:
1. No hourly ridership data is available precluding us from analyzing peak hour trends
2. Weekend vs weekday ridership is not available which leads to the assumption of similar usage patterns of weekends, weekdays, and holidays
3. Data on stops added or removed in these years of study is not explicit 
4. Only stop locations are made available which means route locations will have to be sourced and spatially joined. This allows us to join only the most recent route data for these stops.
5. The dataset for 2023 is incomplete and only includes data for months January to November.

#### 3.3 Data Wrangling

In the data wrangling phase, we cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed the raw datasets to ensure consistency, accuracy, and compatibility with our machine learning models.

### 4. Exploratory Analysis

Before starting the model building, a good understanding about the relationship, the patterns, and the distribution within the dataset is important to get the sense of the model and feature selection for the model development. During the exploratory analysis phase,it's important to uncover valuable insights and patterns that could guide our subsequent modeling efforts.

Initially we conducted various data visualization techniques, including histograms, plots, to show relationships between variables, detect outliers, and identify potential trends.This rigorous exploratory analysis not only enhanced our understanding of the dataset but also laid the foundation for informed feature selection and model design.

How did the current Board and Alight condition of bus passenger in Charlotte? Current available data from CATS allows us to observe the initial visualization of board and alight trend from APC Data


#### 4.1 APC data

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(busstop_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = allTracts_sf, fill = "grey90", alpha = 0.8 , color = NA)+
  geom_sf(aes(color = Board), size = .3) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#FFAB00", high = "darkgreen") +
  mapTheme() +
  labs(title = "Bus Stops", color = "Board Value")

ggplot(busstop_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = allTracts_sf, fill = "grey90", alpha = 0.8 , color = NA)+
  geom_sf(aes(color = Alight), size = .3) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#FFAB00", high = "darkgreen") +
  mapTheme() +
  labs(title = "Bus Stops", color = "Alight Value")

```

#### 4.2 Initial Trends

1. Ridership does not seem to vary too much over the years across all stops based on the given CATS dataset. However, demographic data from ACS 2022 suggests that there has been a steep decline in the percentage of people who commute to work by bus over the last 7 years. This may be attributed to more wealthy people working from home along with more economically disadvantaged people choosing to take the bus. 
2. The global trend suggests that bus ridership during the pandemic did not drop significantly. We suspect that the consistent ridership profile may be due to errors in recording the data for pandemic years. 

##### 4.2.1 Performance before and after the COVID-19 pandemic

To investigate the nature of performance before and after pandemic years further, the difference between average ridership is mapped pre Covid (2017- 2020/3) and post Covid (2020/3 - 2023). This mapping exercise indicates that ridership has decreased in most bus stops post the pandemic. Additionally, some stops show a hundred percent decline. These are filtered out because it may indicate that the stop is no longer in service.

Next, stops with an increase in ridership are separated from stops with a decrease and the results are mapped. This suggests that a majority of stops in the city center have experienced a decrease in ridership. This spatial clustering of underperforming stops suggests areas for targeted intervention.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

Some stops exhibit a growing trend of underperformance post the pandemic.About half of these stops exhibit spatial clustering patterns and are located along a single route. The underperformance and clustering trends in 2022 are consistent with the overall trend in the city center area.


#### 4.3 Spatial factors:

There are other features related to the built environment itself which determins the amount of ridership of an area. In this section, some spatial features will be explored to further reveal bus ridership pattern in the city of Charlotte.

##### 4.3.1 Existing and proposed transit lines and stations

When discussing spatial feature that might affect a bus stop ridership, other existing and proposed transit stops and routes have to be considered, if any. If significant, the distance of bus stops to other transit stops would also serve as variables in the model. In City of Charlotte, there are two existing rail transit line and two proposed rail transit line. The existing transit line in the city are CityLYNX Gold Line and Light Rail - Lynx Blue Line. Meanwhile there are red line and silver line rail transit line that have been proposed to be operated in the city of Charlotte. All of those rail transit line following the existing bus routes are shown in the following map


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
transit <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dat2020, fill = "grey90", alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = bus_routes, aes(color = "Bus Route"), size = 5, alpha = 0.5) +

  geom_sf(data = silver_stops, aes(color = "Silver Line"), size = 2, shape = 21) +
  geom_sf(data = red_routes, aes(color = "Red Line"), size = 8, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_sf(data = red_stops, aes(color = "Red Line"), size = 2, shape = 21) +
  
  labs(title = "Existing and Proposed Transit Lines and Stops") +
    scale_color_manual(name = "Lines",
                     values = c("Bus Route" = "darkgrey",
                                "Blue Line" = "#4682B4", 
                                "Gold Line" = "#FFD700", 
                                "Silver Line" = "purple", 
                                "Red Line" = "#FF6347"),
                     labels = c("Blue Line","Bus Routes", "Gold Line", "Proposed Red Line", "Proposed Silver Line")) +

  mapTheme()

print(transit)

```

##### 4.3.2 Density of Amenities

Besides the nearby transit lines, spatial feature such as schools, parks, police stations, grocery stores, and shopping centers are also considered as the factor of ridership variation in a bus stop. These public amenities are the destinations that bus riders might head to. There might be different pattern of days and time for people to travel to particular amenities, but due to data limitation we would like to see this as a more general pattern.
Following maps represent the density of public amenities in the city of Charlotte. Most amenities in the city are clustered within the city center and expanded to the south, presenting an inequitable distribution. For model input, the distance to the amenities would serve as variables as well.

#### 4.4. Demographic Factors

Demographics is the ultimate features that we consider. Some census characteristic of an area might affect the number of ridership in that particular area. Characteristic such as total population, median household income, race, gender, transportation mode to work, vehicle ownership, etc. are some of the characteristic that might influence somebody preference in transportation mode. 

##### 4.4.1 Mode Trends 

Almost all census tracts with a higher percentage of population that commute by bus to work are located close to bus stops. However, some suburban census tracts with a high percentage of population that commute by bus are far from bus stops. This may be considered as a variable that influences prediction.

##### 4.4.2 By Year and Population

As a brief introduction to Mecklenburg County, which is including the City of Charlotte, we collected census data for census tract from 2017 to 2022. In the following chart below we can see Total Population increase from 2017 to 2022 in direct proportion to the increase of Total Worker Population. During the same period of years, Total Population who work from home have a significant increase, especially during the Covid 19 pandemic. This is likely to affect the number of people traveling to work by bus, which has decreased during this time period.

```

##### 4.4.3. Mode Share

The general trend of percentage of population commute by bus has decreased. The 2022 percentage is halved comparing to 2017 percentage. In comparison, the general trend of percentage of population commute by car has decreased as by more than 10%. Additionally, the general trend of percentage of population commute by bicycle has a subtle decrease. Over the 6 year, it decreased 0.07%. Finally, the general trend of percentage of population commute by walk has slightly increased. Its peak was during Covid-19, but post Covid-19 period, the rate drops.

##### 4.4.4. Demographic Maps

The majority of Mecklenburg County population resides in suburban census tract, a trend that is consistent with the number of employed individuals in the county who also live in the suburbs. However, when examining census data on the use of public transportation to commute to work, a significant proportion is concentrated in the city center and expanded to the south. This can be correlated with census data on the prevalence of working from home, which tends to be dispersed in suburban areas situated relatively farther away from the city center. Following maps explain the dynamic of demographic in City of Charlotte during 2017 to 2022.

From the plotted maps, suburban census tracts in Charlotte have more residents as well as more number of employed workers. For the people commuting to work by bus are largely concentrated in the city center of Charlotte. Meanwhile, work from home trends indicate dominant concentrations in the suburban areas.

```


##### 4.4.5 Spatial Reference of Car Ownership and Commute by Bus

One of the major factor that might affect the bus ridership is the transportation mode option. The following map show the distribution of vehicle ownership in Mecklenburg County census tracts. As shown on the map, there are more households in the suburban area that own private vehicles compared to households in the city center. This is also evident in the map, which indicates that the population primarily using buses for transportation is concentrated in the city center area.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=18, fig.width=12, cache=TRUE}
tp_vars <- c("pctworkwithbus", "pctnocar", "pct1car", "pct2car", "pct3car", "pct4car", "pct5car")
tp_titles <- c("Percent of Population Commute with Bus", "Percent of Household with No Car", "Percent of Household with 1 Car", "Percent of Household with 2 Cars", "Percent of Household with 3 Cars", "Percent of Household with 4 Cars", "Percent of Household with 5 or more Cars")

  j<-j+1
}

do.call(grid.arrange,c(mapList, ncol=2, top="Commute by Bus and Car Ownership of Mecklenburg County in 2022 (Census Tracts)"))
```

##### 4.4.6. Car Ownership Trend

Households with no cars show a declining trend, potentially suggesting less households taking public transportation. In contrast, one-car households slightly increase, indicating a stable preference for single-car ownership. There's a noticeable decline in households with two and three cars, highlighting a shift away from multiple-car ownership, possibly due to rising maintenance costs or a move towards sustainability. However, an opposite trend is observed for four-car and five or more car households, which show a clear increasing trend, indicating that higher car ownership is on the rise, possibly due to higher income levels or larger family sizes. This contrasting data provides critical insights transportation patterns which can influence public transportation planning and infrastructure development.

### 5.Modeling

#### 5.1. Modeling Strategies

In this section, we will build a model to predict future bus ridership in each bus stop. This model will allow CATS transportation planners to test different scenario such as change in demographic features value such as population and median household income, changes in public amenities location, and changes in number of routes served in particular stop that could impact the bus network ridership.

We aim to choose and build an accurate and generalizable model in this section, so CATS transportation planner can get the accurate ridership prediction with minimal error. In order to make the 'best' prediction model, we will look and compare Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Regression Model and Random Forest Model capture variability in our dataset. The feature engineering in this model consist of 3 categories: Demographic, Proximity to Amenities, and Network Characteristics. In the Demographic category, we use some input features, such as: Population, Median Income, Median Rent, Commute to Work, Race, Gender, Work Mode, Car Ownership, Population Density. As the proximity to amenities, we choose distance to: Schools, Parks, Grocery Stores, Police Offices, Shopping Centers, Light Rail Stops. And for the Network Characteristic, we analyze: Number of Routes served by each bus stop, Total Stops in the Route that served by each bus stop, and Distance from each bus stop to City Center. We also use the Month feature in training the model to capture seasonal changing in bus ridership.

The dependent variable we used is the daily average ridership for each stop in 2022. Then, the daily average prediction multiplied by the number of days the bus operates to obtain the monthly ridership count.We chose the data from 2022 as our training data, assuming that this data is not influenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the modeling process, we split 70% of the data into training set and the rest will be in the test set. Then we will test the model on the test set data and get the modelâ€™s performance.


#### 5.2. Feature Engineering

In the demographics category, data about population, median income and other census data is collected. For demographics, we used spatial join to join the census data with bus stop ridership data from APC based on the census tract geometry.

In the proximity to amenities category, information about where the amenities located is collected from open data portal. We created new features to the table by calculating the nearest neighbors distance of each bus stop in the training data (2022 ridership data) to the closest 5 of each public amenities used: schools, parks, grocery stores, police offices, shopping centers, and light rail stops.

In the network characteristic category, we joined the bus routes data with the bus stop ridership data from APC based on the bus stop ID. Then we calculate the total routes that served in each bus stop, and total stops in that particular route. We also added a point representing the downtown area of Charlotte to measure the distance of each bus stop to this point. This was done under the assumption that the downtown area serves as the economic center and is a destination for a significant portion of bus users.

#### 5.3. Modeling Results

##### 5.3.1. OLS

We first have to have the independent variable and predictors ready, the we split the 2022 transit data into 70/30 of training and testing datasets. Then we fit a linear regression model using the training data. The model predicts Avg_ridership based on a variety of predictors.
Using the test data, we calculate predictions and evaluate the error metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Absolute Percentage Error (APE). These metrics help in understanding the accuracy of the model predictions. The R^2 is around 0.17, which is not a optimal number for a model of high predicting power.Although some predictors demonstrate significant correlations with the independent variable, others are not showing this significance.

Residual plots from this OLS model doesn't scatter randomly, indicating potential heteroscedasticity.

We plot the actual vs. predicted ridership to visually assess the model's performance. A line of perfect prediction is added for reference. Based on our results, there are many points of predictions off the line actuality by much, therefore we do not consider the OLS model has high predictive power and accuracy.

abline(0, 1, col = "red")  # Add a line of perfect prediction (y = x)
```

Using the testing dataset now converted to a spatial format, we create a map to visualize the absolute error in predictions across different geographic locations.The map indicates that for some stops the absolute errors of the OLS model is larger than 300 ridership, further indicates this model does not perform well in predicting average ridership based on the predictors provided.

##### 5.3.2. Random Forest Model 1 : Bus Stops

###### 5.3.2.1 Random Forest Model 1 Result

Same as the OLS model, we ran a random forest model of bus stops following the same process. The output from your Random Forest regression model indicates a highly effective model for predicting Avg_ridership, as shown by the 94.95% of variance explained in the dependent variable. This high percentage suggests that the model does an excellent job of capturing the relationships and patterns within the data, which is further supported by the mean of squared residuals at 18.31362, indicating the predictions are generally close to the actual values. The model, built with 500 trees and evaluating 16 variables at each split, demonstrates robust predictive performance.

We also created this Actual vs. Prediction plot, we can see the predictions are now more close to the line of perfect prediction than OLS model, which further indicates the fact that the performance of random forest model is better.

Absolute errors have a significant decrease as well, none, of the bus stops possess an absolute error greater than 75.

###### 5.3.2.2 Random Forest Model 1 Generalizability

The residuals are centered around the zero line (marked by the red dashed line), which is generally a good sign. This suggests that there's no systematic bias in the model predictions overall. There is a noticeable increase in the spread of residuals as fitted values increase, particularly visible past a fitted value of about 200. This could indicate heteroscedasticityâ€”where the variability in residuals is not constant across all levels of the predictor variables. In other words, the model might be less reliable at predicting higher values.

##### 5.3.3. Random Forest Model 2 : Bus Routes

As the transit system is not only formed with stops but connected through routes, and one stop may belong to multiple routes, so it is essential to analyze the pattern of bus routes as well. So we ran a second random forest model of bus stops following the same process with the network characteristics added. We ran the same process to train the second random forest model for predicting the Avg_ridership. Trained using 500 trees, and at each decision splot, 20 variables are randomly considered. Results indicates Mean of Squared Residuals is 10.75963 and a remarkably high 97.03% of the variance explained. 


###### 5.3.3.1. Random Forest Model 2 Result

We also created this Actual vs. Prediction plot for the second random forest model. We can see the predictions are better thatn the previous model and more close to the line of perfect prediction than OLS model and the first Random Forest Model, which further indicates the fact that the performance of Random Forest Model 2 is better. Absolute errors have a significant decrease as well, none, of the bus stops possess an absolute error greater than 75.

The predictions generated by the model represent the average daily bus passenger forecast. To obtain the monthly forecast, the daily prediction value is then multiplied by the number of days the bus stop operates.

Additionally, analyzing which features are most influential in predicting ridership can provide valuable insights and help in refining the model further by adjusting parameters, so we changed the number of trees or the mtry value.The model was tuned using 5-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal number of predictors (mtry) at each decision split, with 25 being selected as optimal. The final model fitting used the full training dataset, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.372992, indicating the average absolute error in the ridership predictions. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is reported as Infinity (Inf), which often occurs when actual values used in the denominator are zero or near zero, leading to undefined or infinite values in the percentage error calculations.

### 6. Use-Case Scenario


The original goal of building this model is to provide predictions of bus ridership in Charlotte. As explained in the workflow, the model is constructed using demographic features, distances to public amenities, and network characteristics. Therefore, the predictions of bus ridership that can be made using this model occur when there are changes in the values of these input features.

This motivates us to develop an application to assist CATS transportation planners in predicting future ridership numbers when changes such as shifts in population demographics, modifications to public facilities, or alterations in the number of bus stops occur. As information for future transportation planners for development, decision-making, risk mitigation, and problem-solving, the insights provided by this model will be invaluable

In this project we create three different scenarios for ridership change in city of Charlotte.

#### 6.1 Scenario 1: Increase in Population Density

The last measured population density for Charlotte, NC was 2,827 in 2018. Charlotte, NC experienced an average growth rate of 2.87% from our first statistic recorded in 2009. If past trends continue, we forecast the population density growth rate would be 15% from 2022 to 2027 and 30% from 2022 to 2032.
Population density increase does not affect average ridership by much but decreases underperforming stops. In both 2027 and 2032, we would see ridership larger than 300 at stops located at the southwestern periphery and downtown of the county, but still the majority of the stops with ridership under 100. The southeastern and northern area of the county is having the most stops with average ridership under 10 in January 2027 and January 2032, but the total number of stops with average ridership decresed from 2027 to 2032.

#### 6.2 Scenario 2: Increase in Median Income

Between 2020 and 2021 Charlotte's median household income grew from $65,359 to $68,367, a 4.6% increase. It will be an increase of 25% from 2022 to 2027 and 50% from2022 to 2032.
As income increases, the average ridership does not change much. Average ridership larger than 300 at stops located at the southwestern periphery and downtown of the county, but still the majority of the stops with ridership under 100. However, less bus stops is having monthly average ridership under 10 in 2032 than 2027.

#### 6.3 Scenario 3: Add 2 Proposed Light Rail Stops as Feature

The density of new stops of the proposed light rail is the highest in the city center area.
Following the same process of modeling and visualizing, we test the dataset adding the two proposed light rail data using random forest and assessed its performance using Actual vs. Prediction plot and absolute error map. We also mapping out the underperforming stops.

### 7. Web Application

We developed a web application for CATS transportation planner to help understanding the current transportation system's status and predicting future changes. Specifically, the app focuses on forecasting passenger numbers while considering demographic shifts, changes in public amenities, and the addition of new stops or routes. This tool provides valuable insights for planners to make informed decisions, optimize resources, and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the transportation network in Charlotte.
